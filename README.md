# XLayer quick documentation

## Concept
The idea behind XLayer is to enable everyone to parse an XML file describing a set of java objects creation and assembly along with method calls and variable management.

## Document Syntax

### Document root object

As for all XML files, there must be a root element.
```xml
<root>
</root>
```

This root element may be the keycode "xlayer", that will be ignored - but is necessary for XML.
<xlayer>
</xlayer>
